# Annotations

### Java
**Annotations** tell the compiler to check for certain criteria

Annotations:
- start with '@'
- they are hints to the compiler to check for errors
- A simple example is the '@Override' annotation in Java that tells the compiler to check if the method being overridden is an actual method to be overridden and other such errors
