# Class Extension

Classes can extend other classes to inherit or add on to its members. For example, a car class could inherit a vehicle class in order to inherit some of the vehicle class' methods.

An important point (in java) is that only one class can be extended while multiple [[Interfaces|interfaces]] can be implemented 

With class extension, you can "bring along" the functionaality of a [[super class]]
