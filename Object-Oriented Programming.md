### Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming
- [[Encapsulation]] refers to creating small code bits such as classes and interfaces
- [[Inheritance]] refers to the super and child structure of classes in OOP
- [[Polymorphism]] refers to the ability to call a function with the same name and return different functionality based on the type the function is being called on or the types of the parameters passed

### Some Features of Object-Oriented Programming
- [[Interfaces]] are a contract between module writers and module users and the compiler. Interfaces are implemented by classes where the classes must implement the methods specified in the interface. Interfaces are useful for large companies that want to have developers 
- [[Dynamic Binding]] is the idea that a variable's type can be defined at run-time instead of just at  compile time. Dynamic Binding uses the basis of [[polymorphism]] to decide which implementation of a method to run based on the type the method is being called on.
- [[Class Extenstion]] involves [[child class|child classes]] extending or inheriting members from a [[super class]]
