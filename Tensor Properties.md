# Tensor Properties

### Data Types
 One property of Tensors is their datatype. Like arrays in languages like C and Java, Tensors can only contain one type of data type. For pytorch, some datatypes are built into the library and need to be used as such: torch.(datatype). And example of this is torch.float16 which are floating point numbers with 16 bits assigned to their memory
 
 ### Dimension
 Tensors also have dimensions.
