# Tensors

Tensors are very similar to matrices. Tensors can be 3D,2D,5D, or even 0D (just a scalar number). In other words, tensors can have infinite dimensions.

You can create tensors with multiple commands: [[Creating Tensors]]

Tensors consist of many properties such as a datatype(dtypes) and dimension

Tensors can have operations done on them [[Tensor Operations]]
